With Git Versioning Control I can create branch and versions of my code
- I first create a folder, and then I type "git init", to initialize the reposity.
- The initial branch is named "main", otherwise I must change its name
- With "git branch" I create a new branch
- With "git checkout" I change the current branch
- With "git checkout -b name-branch" I create and change to this new branch
