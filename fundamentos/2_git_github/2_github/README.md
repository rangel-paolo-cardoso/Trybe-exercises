# This is a README file to talk about Github

- Github is a cool platform to keep my code safe and sound
- I can download a project using the "Code" button
- After downloading, I don't need to use the command <b>git init</b>
- So if I change anything in my project, all I need is the git commands
- I add it with <b>git add .</b>
- Then I commit it, <b>git commit -m "A message"</b>
- Finally I send it, <b>git push -u origin main</b>
