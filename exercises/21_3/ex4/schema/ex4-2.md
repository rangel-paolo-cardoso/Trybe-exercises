#### 1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`.

Query: 
```sql
select first_name, last_name 
from actor;
```
Result:

  ![image](./1a.png)

#### 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`.

Query:
```sql
select upper(concat(first_name, ' ', last_name))   'Actor Name'
from actor;
```
Result:

  ![image](./1b.png)

#### 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?

Query: 
```sql
select actor_id, first_name, last_name 
from actor 
where lower(first_name) = lower("Joe");
```
Result:

  ![image](./2a.png)

#### 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:

Query: 
```sql
select * 
from actor 
where upper(last_name) like '%GEN%';
```
Result:

  ![image](./2b.png)

#### 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:

Query: 
```sql
select * 
from actor 
where upper(last_name) like '%LI%' 
order by last_name, first_name;
```
Result:

  ![image](./2c.png)

#### 2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:

Query: 
```sql
select country_id, country 
from country 
where country in ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');
```
Result:

  ![image](./2d.png)

#### 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`, as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` are significant).

According to Ozair Kafray @ [Stackexchange.com](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/154786/is-a-blob-more-efficient-than-a-varchar-for-data-that-can-be-any-size)

```md
I would suggest using TEXT over BLOB.

Primary Difference

- TEXT and BLOB is stored off the table with the table just having a pointer to the location of the actual storage.
- VARCHAR is stored inline with the table.

Primary Guideline

1. Text format messages should almost always be stored as TEXT (they end up being arbitrarily long)
2. String attributes should be stored as VARCHAR (the destination user name, the subject, etc...).
```

Query: 
```sql
select * from actor;

ALTER TABLE actor
ADD COLUMN description BLOB;

select * from actor;
```
Result:

  ![image](./3a.png)

#### 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the `description` column.

Query: 
```sql
select * from actor;

alter table actor
drop column description;

select * from actor;
```
Result:

  ![image](./3b.png)

#### 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.

Query: 
```sql
select last_name, count(*) actor_count 
from actor 
group by last_name
order by actor_count desc, last_name;
```
Result:

  ![image](./4a.png)

#### 4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors

Query: 
```sql
select last_name, count(*) actor_count 
from actor 
group by last_name
having actor_count >1
order by actor_count desc, last_name;
```
Result:

  ![image](./4b.png)

#### 4c. The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`. Write a query to fix the record.

Query: 
```sql
select * from actor where first_name = 'GROUCHO' and last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

update actor set first_name = 'HARPO', last_name = 'WILLIAMS' where first_name = 'GROUCHO' and last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

select * from actor where last_name = 'WILLIAMS';
```
Result:

  ![image](./4c.png)

#### 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.

Query: 
```sql
update actor set first_name = 'GROUCHO', last_name = 'WILLIAMS' where first_name = 'HARPO' and last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

select * from actor where last_name = 'WILLIAMS';
```
Result:

  ![image](./4d.png)

#### 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the `address` table. Which query would you use to re-create it?


Query: 
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE address;
```

Result:


  ![image](./5a.png)

```sql
CREATE TABLE `address` (
  `address_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `address` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `address2` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `district` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `city_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `postal_code` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
  `phone` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `location` geometry NOT NULL,
  `last_update` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`address_id`),
  KEY `idx_fk_city_id` (`city_id`),
  SPATIAL KEY `idx_location` (`location`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_address_city` FOREIGN KEY (`city_id`) REFERENCES `city` (`city_id`) ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=606 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```


#### 6a. Use `JOIN` to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables `staff` and `address`:

Query: 
```sql
select stf.first_name, stf.last_name, adr.address, adr.district, adr.postal_code, adr.city_id 
from staff stf
left join address adr
on stf.address_id = adr.address_id;
```
Result:

  ![image](./6a.png)

#### 6b. Use `JOIN` to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables `staff` and `payment`.

Query: 
```sql
select stf.first_name, stf.last_name, sum(pay.amount)
from staff stf
left join payment pay
on stf.staff_id = pay.staff_id
WHERE month(pay.payment_date) = 8
and year(pay.payment_date)  = 2005
group by stf.first_name, stf.last_name;
```
Result:

  ![image](./6b.png)

#### 6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables `film_actor` and `film`. Use inner join.

Query: 
```sql
select flm.title, count(*) number_of_actors
from film flm
inner join film_actor fim_act
on flm.film_id = fim_act.film_id
group by flm.title
order by number_of_actors desc;
```
Result:

where lower(flm.title) = lower('Hunchback Impossible')
group by flm.title;
```
Result:

  ![image](./6d.png)

#### 6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:

Query: 
```sql
select cust.first_name, cust.last_name, sum(pay.amount) 'Total Amount Paid' 
from payment pay
join customer cust
on pay.customer_id = cust.customer_id
group by cust.first_name, cust.last_name
order by cust.last_name;
```
Result:

  ![image](./6e.png)


#### 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters `K` and `Q` whose language is English.

Query: 
```sql
select title
from film 
where (title like 'K%' or title like 'Q%')
and language_id in (
	select language_id 
	from language 
	where name = 'English'
)
order by title;
```
Result:

  ![image](./7a.png)

#### 7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film `Alone Trip`.

Query: 
```sql
select first_name, last_name 
from actor
where actor_id in (
	select actor_id

	)
);
```
Result:
